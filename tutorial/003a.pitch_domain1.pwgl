The pitches of a voice in the solution is built as a combination of candidates from its pitch domain. A pitch is indicated with its MIDI note number. It is also possible to define pitches as part of a melodic profile that can be transposed.

The pitches in the pitch domain can be organized in four different ways (or as a combination of some or all of them): 

1. As single pitches
2. As pitch motifs fixed on absolute pitches
3. As chords
4. As transposable melodic profile

Note that it is necessary to give at least one duration in the rhythm domain when searching for pitches (a rhythm domain with only one candidate will never trigger its engine to backtrack, and will therefore not slow down the search process for the pitch engine).

Ex.1 - single pitches
'((60)(62)(64)(65)(67)(69)(71)(72))
Each individual pitch is separated by brackets.

Ex.2 - fixed pitch motifs
'((60 63 65)(67 66 65))

Note how several pitches are grouped inside the same brackets in the pitch motifs. Pitches in a fixed motif have a fixed order that cannot be changed by the search engine.
