Every rule that have been discussed up to this point can be applied to more than one voice by simply replacing the number of the voice it constrains by a list of voice numbers: The rule will be applied to all voices in the list. Using the same rule in more than one voice will not create a polyphonic relationship since the rule restrict the voices independent of each other.

In the example patch, the r-pitches-one-voice box is set to be applied to both voice number 0 and 1. The rule forces both voices to create 12-tone rows (how this is done was explained in tutorial 005e).

--
Polyphonc rules constrain the relation between elements in two or more voices.

In the example patch, the r-pitch-pitch boxes create polyphonic relations between pitches in two voices. Both of the boxes are set to access all harmonic pitch pairs between the voices (the menu in the second row is set to :all). Since the two voices have the same rhythm, the application of the rule id straight forward: each harmonic pitch pair is passed to the abstraction. The format is '(pitch-voice1 pitch-voice2). If more than one input is used on the abstraction, it will recevice consecutive pitch pairs (not in this patch). 

The first r-pitch-pitch rule calculates the harmonic interval between the two pitches, and constrains it to only be 3, 4, 7, 8 or 9 semi-tones large (open the abstraction to see how it is done).

The second r-pitch-pitch rule is set to force the first voice to be above the second.
