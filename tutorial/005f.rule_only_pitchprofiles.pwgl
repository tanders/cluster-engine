Rule that only allow pitch profiles:

If the domain contains pitch profiles (see tutorial 003b), it also has to contain at least  one candidate with fixed pitches (in this example MIDI note 60). If 60 is only considered the starting point, it is not desired that the engine picks this candidate more than once. The rule r-only-m-motifs assures this.


Rules for durations at time-points:

The r-rhythm-one-voice-at-timepoints has similarities to an index rule: The rule constrain a specific variable. The difference is that which variable(s) depend on their time point in the score. The position of a variable vary depends on the durations of the previous events in the score. 

The abstraction in the example patch receives a list with the information '(offset duration).  Offset is the duration between the starting point of the duration and the timepoint given by the user on the r-rhythm-one-voice-at-timepoints box.  If the duration starts at the given timepoint, the offset will be 0. If the duration starts before the timepoint (and thus sustain over the timepoint) the offset will be a negative fraction. The abstraction needs as many inputs as there are given time points.

In the example patch, the rule forces the 3rd measure to have a quarter note at the first downbeat.
