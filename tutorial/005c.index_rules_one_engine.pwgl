In this example, the index rule restricts the relation between the 1st and the 3rd variable in the pitch engine. Note that the r-index-pitches-one-voice box has its menu set to :index-for-cell. With this setting, the box will not receive two pitches but two lists with either motifs, chords or individual pitches: the exact format depends on the candidates in the domain. Note that pitch profiles (not part of this example) will be converted to their absolute (i.e. transposed) pitches.

In the example, the domain contains 6 individual pitches and 2 motifs that both are built of 2 pitches, '(62 67) and '(66 67). The rule will force the 1st and 3rd to be equal (open the abstraction to see how this is done). 

Note that '= can not be used to compare lists in Lisp. This is the reason why 'equal is used inside the abstraction.

Try to change the menu setting to :position-for-pitches. The system behaves slightly different with this setting, since the system will consider pitches inside motifs as separate elements." :X 5 :Y 22 :WIDTH 730 :HEIGHT 530))) (WINDOW-SELECT WIN) WIN)
