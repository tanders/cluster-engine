This patch illustrates the r-chords rule, and also a r-pitch-pitch rule constraining three voices.

The r-chords rule restrict the structure of the harmony the voices make up together. This rule is set to restric all three voices '(0 1 2). The allowed chord structures are given as intervallic models. In the example patch, there are two allowed chord models: '(4 7) and '(3 7). The intervals are counted from the bass note. In this example major chords '(4 7) and minor chords '(3 7) are allowed. All inversions of the given chords are also allowed, and pitches can be transposed into any octave.

To make the chords more tidy, there is a r-pitch-pitch rule that will assure that the first voice is on top and the third voice is the lowest. The list of voices is defined as '((0 1)(1 2)): Each sublist will generate a separate rule.

The last r-pitch-pitch rule accesses three voices. It makes sure that pitch classes are not repeated within a chord, i.e. all chords are complete with three different pitches.

The r-pitches-one-voice constrain melodic intervals in the first two voices to be only seconds and thirds.

There is a high chance that the solution will contain parallel fifths. It would be possible to avoid this with an additional r-pitch-pitch rule forbidding parallel fifths." :X 11 :Y 62 :WIDTH 730 :HEIGHT 530))) (WINDOW-SELECT WIN) WIN)
