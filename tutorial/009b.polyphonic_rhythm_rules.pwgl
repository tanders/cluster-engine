The r-rhythm-rhythm accesses durations in two voices. It passes the information about the length of the durations and how they are positioned relative to each other (i.e. if their onset is simultaneous, or if there is an offset between them). This information is chosen in the first menu in the middle row  (never pass more information than the abstraction need, since that will make the search less efficient).

The menu in the third row sets the time points for where the rule is checked: either it is only checked at notes in the first voice (:at-durations-v1), or it is checked at notes AND rests (:at-events-v1). Note that even if the rule is only checked at notes, it might find simultaneous rests in the other voice (rests will be indicated as negative fractions).

In the example patch, the rule is checked at the onset of each note in the first voice. The information that is passed to the abstraction has the format '(duration-voice1 offset duration-voice2). The offset is the duration between the onset for the duration in the first voice and the onset for the duration in the second voice (a negative offset means that the event in the second voice starts before the event in the first voice).

The rule restricts onsets in the two voices to never be simultaneous (open the abstraction to see how it is done). Note that there is a risk that the solution contains many rests to satisfy the constraint." :X 5 :Y 22 :WIDTH 730 :HEIGHT 530))) (WINDOW-SELECT WIN) WIN)
