The r-rhythm-hierarchy will create an hierarchical relation between events in different voices. In a hierarchical rhythmic relationship, one voice contains the basic events and a second voice contains more rhythmic details (it can be thought of as more ornamental details). The second voice will automatically include the basic events from the first voice. 

In the example patch, the r-rhythm-hierarchy is set to create a hierarchic relation between the first and second voice, and between the second and third voice (the setting '(0 1 2) ). 

In the example, you can see in the solution in the score-editor that every onset in the first voice exist as an onset in the second voice. You will also find a few extra onsets in the second voice. You can further see that every onset in the second voice exist as an onset in the third voice, and that there are a few extra onsets in the third voice as well.

Note that the r-rhythm-hierarchy also accepts sublists with independent rhythmic hierarchical relations such as '((0 1)(2 3)). Even though '(0 1 2) would result with the same solution as '((0 1) (1 2)), it is if possible not recommended to break up the hierarchy into two sublists: the engine would not be able to search as efficient (the speed difference can be big).

In this example, the r-rhythm-hierarchy will break down the constraint into three rules to optimize search efficiency (the user will not need to be aware of this)." :X 5 :Y 22 :WIDTH 730 :HEIGHT 530))) (WINDOW-SELECT WIN) WIN)
