RULES THREE VOICES

This patch illustrates how it is possible to include more tan two voices in a r-pitch-pitch rule.

The leftmost r-pitch-pitch box is set to acess three voices '(0 1 2). An input in the attached abstraction will receive a list with the format '(pitch-voice1 pitch-voice2 pitch-voice3). The rule forces the harmonic interval between voice 0 and 1 to be identical to the harmonic interval between voice 1 and 2.

The second r-pitch-pitch rule constrains the harmonic intervals between voice 0 and 1 to be of 2 - 9 semitones size.

the r-pitches one voice restricts melodic intervalls in the first and third voice to be seconds or thirds.

Note that the pitch domains only contain pitches from a C major scale." :X 5 :Y 22 :WIDTH 730 :HEIGHT 530))) (WINDOW-SELECT WIN) WIN)
