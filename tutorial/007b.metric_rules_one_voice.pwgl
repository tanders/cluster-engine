METRIC RULES (cont.)

The r-meter-note constrains the relation between the meter and notes: It will constrain notes that are positioned at metric beats (i.e. notes that start at the beat, or notes that are sustained over the position of the beat). Notes that are not positioned at beats will be ignored by the rule. Compare the r-meter-note box to how the r-note-meter box works (see next tutorial).

The r-meter-note box in the example patch is set to only restrict the first beat in each measure (the setting :1st-beat). The rule will restrict the first event in every measure to be a quarter note starting at the beat.

In the second row on the box there is a menu that allow the user to select between six different input modes. The first two and the last two options are for constraining durations that coinside with beats. The middle two modes are for constraining durations AND THEIR PITCHES that coinside with beats. If the rule is not dependent on pitch, those two modes should neot be used (it would slow down the search process).

In the example patch, the input mode is :offset_dur. In this mode, the rule will constrain durations that coinside with beats. The pitch of the event will be ignored. The r-meter-note box will pass a list with the format '(offset duration) to the abstraction. Offset is the distance between the current beat position and the starting point of the duration. If the offset is 0, it means that the starting point coinsides with the beat position. If the duration starts before and sustains over the beat position, the offset will be the negative distance between the starting poit of the duration and the beat.

Note that a grace note will never coinside with a beat: the concept  of a grace note is that it preceeds the beat, while the main note the grace note is slurred to is positioned at the beat.
