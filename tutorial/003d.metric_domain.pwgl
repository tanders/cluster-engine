:WINDOW-DOCUMENTATION "BASIC SETUP OF THE METRIC DOMAIN

Ex.1 - simple definition
'((4 4) (5 8))

The simple way to define a domain of metric structure is to give a list of time signatures for the engine to choose from. For many cases, it is suficiant to use the simple definition.

Ex.2 - detailed definition

By using the metric-domain box, it is possible to give a more detailed definition of how the metric structure interacts with the musical events.

Each row in the metric-domain box sets the behaviour of an allowed metric structure. 

The first input in a row is the time signature. 

The third input is the beat length; if this is set to 'nil, the second number in the time signature will be assumed as the beat length. 

The second row in the example patch has the time signature '(6 8) and the beat length 3/8. That means that the length of the beat is NOT 1/8 (as it would be understood by default) but 3/8. The first row has nil in this input, which means that the default setting will be used (for a '(4 4) time signature the default beat length is 1/4). This setting affects how rules that constrain downbeats behave.

The seond input is a list of subdivisions of the beat. Some rules (mainly r-metric-hierarchy) will be affected by this seting. If the simple definition is used (i.e. if the user does not use the metric-domain box), the system will use the subdivision '(3 4) as default setting. Se further on in this tutorial.
