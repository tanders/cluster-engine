(defun heuristic-switch-rule-2-engines-events-offset-to-metric-structure-include-rests (simple-rule rhythm-engine1 flag-for-metric-access weight)
  "Formats a heuristic switch rule for offsets for events (including rests and gracenotes), i.e. how events are positioned in relation to the pulse.
This rule has more of an impact than heuristic-switch-rule-2-engines-durations-offset-to-metric-beat-ignor-rests since also endpoints for duratins and rests
can be used to check the rule. In this way, sorting might be done one more variables.
If rests are not used in the domain, this rule is to prefer for this reason.

This rule is more efficient than rule-2-engines-durations-offset-to-metric-beat-ignor-rests since also endpoints for duratins and rests
can be used to check the rule. In this way, problems might be detected one step earlier, and some backtracking can be avoided.
