  "Formats a rule for how notes (i.e. durations with pitch or rests) are positioned at metric points. Grace notes are ignored. 
Also the length of the duration or rest will be passed to the logic statement.

The logic statement will receive '(offset duration pitch).

If the pitch information is not used: use the rule that only checks two engiens (it will be more efficient).
