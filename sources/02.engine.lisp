;  CLUSTER ENGINE
;
;  Copyright Orjan Sandred 2010. If you use this code, you will do it on your own risk. I will not take any
;  responsibility to any damaged any bugs might create.
;
;  The cluster engine is a set of engines that search for solutions to parallel sequences of variables. The
;  sequences can have constraints that defines relationships between the sequences. The system is specialiced
;  in musical problems. Therefore there is a strict protocol for what different engines search for:
;  The first engine seraches for a sequence of durations, the second engine searches for a sequence of pitches
;  for these durations. These two engines will thus be a voice together. Any number of voices can be searched 
;  for: every sencond engine serahces for durations and every second for pitches. The last engine searches for 
;  a sequence of time signatures that will relate to all voices.
;
;  Each engine has its own domain. The system first puts all domains into a array (to keep track on what domain 
;  relates to which engine). Then the search indexes (one for each engine) are initated to -1. A default order 
;  for how the engines are searched is set: metric engine, engine 0, engine 1, engine 2, engine 3, etc.
;  
;  The serach startes with steping the index of the first engine to 0, and initiates the variable (i.e. the full 
;  domaon for that engine is put into its first variable). The first candidate in the list at a variable is 
;  considered the candidate that passed the rule (if it fails, it will be poped).
;
;  The next step takes place within the main loop for the search engines. The rules are applied on the first candidate.
;  If it passes, the forward rule will determine what engine will be visited next: its index will be increased, and 
;  the new variable will be initiated (as above). It it fails, it will be passed to a loop (inside the fail function)
;  that searches for the next candidate to test - either the next in the list, or (if the list is empty) the system will 
;  backtrack according to a backtrack rule.
;
;  The system will now jump back to the beginning of the loop (and apply the rules on the new candidate).
;
;  When the new index of any engine becomes higher than the length of the array, the search is interrupted and the 
;  solution is output. If a next index is reduced to -1 in the fail-loop, the system will return an empty solution (i.e. 
;  it could not find a solution).
;
;  The solution can be found in two arrays: in vsolution all candidates can be found (the search path depends on this 
;  array. The vlinear-solution is an optimized storage for the temporary solution. This presents every engine's
;  temporary solution as a flat list. This makes it easier (i.e. faster) for most rules to access the temporary solution.
;  The vlinear-solution is updated just befor the rules are applied (in the test-rules function). Engines that have
;  changed their solution since last cycle are flagged. Only flagged engines will be updated.
