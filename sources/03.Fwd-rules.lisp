  "A forward rule (dynamic variable ordering) for CLUSTERENGINE. A forward rule returns the index of the engine where next variable should be visited.

Somewhat simplified, this variable ordering progresses in score time \"from left to  right\‚Äù, completing all voices in parallel. More specifically, this variable ordering always visits next the engine where the solution is most behind in score time in the search, but in case of ties, the meter engine is visited first, and all rhythm engines before any pitch engine (engine type priorities). In case of ties on engine type priority, the engine with lowest engine index is visited first.

This variable ordering is suitable for polyphonic CSPs in general, including for CSPs where the rhythm is fixed in the CSP definition (by a single rhythm motif in the rhythm domain), and only the pitches are searched for (other forward rules are less suitable for this case)."
