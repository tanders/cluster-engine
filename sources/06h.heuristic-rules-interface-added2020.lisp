;;;;;;; MAY 19, 2020 ----- NEW HEURISTIC (HR) RULES FOR R-NOTE-METER AND R-METER-NOTE 

(defun heuristic-rule-3-engines-notes-and-their-offset-to-metric-structure-include-rests-indicate-timesignature (simple-rule rhythm-engine1 pitch-engine3 flag-for-metric-access)
  "Formats a heuristic  rule for offsets for notes (including pitches and rests), i.e. how notes are positioned in relation to the pulse.
The rule will also access the event ratio (= length), the timesignature for the measure where the events onset exist and the pitch. 
Grace notes are inluded.

The onsets from the 1st engine are used for inputpoints: rests and gracenotes are removed and ignored.

A rule receives one list with all information in the format '((duration-engine1 offset duration-engine2) (duration-engine1 offset duration-engine2) ...).
Example: '((1/4 0 -1/8) (1/4 -1/8 1/4) ...)
