(defun rule-2-engines-events-offset-to-metric-structure-include-rests (simple-rule rhythm-engine1 flag-for-metric-access)
  "Formats a rule for offsets for events (including rests and gracenotes), i.e. how events are positioned in relation to the pulse.
This rule is more efficient than rule-2-engines-durations-offset-to-metric-beat-ignor-rests since also endpoints for duratins and rests
can be used to check the rule. In this way, problems might be detected one step earlier, and some backtracking can be avoided.
If rests are not used in the domain, this rule is to prefer for this reason.
