  Use this box to collect all rules before inputting them to the Cluster engine. It is possible to input the output of this box to a second Rules->Cluster box (to help organizing your rules in groups). 


* TODO COMMENT Revise Automatic Common Lisp Doc Extraction

  - Add index support (e.g., directly with Sphinx syntax)


** DONE Old
   CLOSED: [2017-09-18 Mon 02:17]
   - My current Org mode macro =defun= does not yet support multi-line doc strings, quite possibly because I removed the surrounding strings...
     -> Using Lisp code blocks instead of Orgmode macros seems to be a way around

   - The macro =defun= HTML export is not clean, e.g., the index extry to generate is actually shown
     -> Problem solved with export to rST
