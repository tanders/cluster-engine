# Dependencies 

   - Emacs with org mode
   - Some Lisp compiler, and Emacs configured to be able to run Lisp code (e.g., with slime or slime-connect)
   - Ox-Rst (https://github.com/masayuko/ox-rst)
   - Sphinx (http://www.sphinx-doc.org)

   - Optionally: docparser (https://github.com/eudoxia0/docparser)

   - Custom code of this project


  It might be possible to later turn the process above into a shell script, e.g., see
  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2008-03/msg00154.html

  or with a Makefile

# How to use

  - Start Emacs and connect to Lisp compiler
  - Load Readme.org into Emacs. Emacs will ask whether to load variables -- confirm by pressing `y`
  - Publish Org project, e.g., with the following key sequence: C-c C-e P x. Then select the project to publish ("cluster-engine-doc"), e.g, with TAB.
     Doing so exports all *.org files within this directory into *.rst files into the directory ../doc_source_sphinx
  - Build the resulting Sphinx documention in ../doc_source_sphinx, e.g., by calling ../make-doc.sh
